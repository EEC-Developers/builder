# Builder
This was originally written to demonstrate how [an object-oriented framework](https://github.com/EEC-Developers/framework) could streamline the development of an application. It has proven to me that it doesn't actually help much at all. All the private fields in objects and the getter and setter methods are more trouble than they are worth. Code is generally not very reusable so making a reusable framework is not a worthy goal after all.

If I finish this, I might just use GNU Make as a backend and treat Builder as a translation layer.
